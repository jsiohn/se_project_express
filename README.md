# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application using Express, MongoDB, and Postman for testing. I've gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. Soon, there will also be a server with an API and authentication functions.

## Technologies Used

- Mongoose, Express, MongoDB, React Routers, NodeJS
- Postman
